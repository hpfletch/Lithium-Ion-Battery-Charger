# Lithium Ion Battery Charger

This simple device charges single cell lithium ion batterys for use with battery powered devices. It's based on a Microchip MCP73833 linear charge controller which offers features such as programmable charge current, charge status indication and automatic end-of-charge control, to name a few.

Power is supplied to the device from any 5V USB cell phone charghing brick USB power connection on a personal computer. I have designed and tested a small form factor PCB which is assembled with SMD components to reduce the overall footprint.
